## Project Requirements
The following design guidelines should be followed:

- Colors.
- Typography: font face, size and weight.
- Layout: composition and space between elements.
- The pages should look almost identical to the original design. Small adjustments like text or image changes are acceptable.
- You can use a CSS framework (for example Bootstrap) for styling, if you want to.
- You should build only these 2 pages:
  - The home page.
  - The about page.
- Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes:
  - Mobile: up to 768px wide. 
  - Desktop: 768px or wider.
  
  - Interactions
    - Links
      - The home page should have a link in the menu to the about page.
      - The logo in the header links to the home page.
    - Mobile menu
      - When the user clicks (or taps) the hamburger button on the header, the mobile menu appears over the page.
      - There are no guidelines for the mobile menu in the docs, but you should implement it so it is consistent with the design (colors, typography, spacings, etc.).
      - The mobile menu should have a close (X) button that closes the menu.
    - Dynamic page
      - The section "Featured speakers" should be created dynamically in JavaScript.
      - You should use a JavaScript variable with the data about the speakers and use it when the page loads to create the HTML for this section dynamically.
